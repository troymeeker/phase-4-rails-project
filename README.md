Description:
This app utilizes a React frontend and a Rails backend. 

This app is a very basic Craigslist clone, and more is planned to continue improvement of this app. 

Upon the user creating an account with a username and password, they can browse the current list of items available for sale. For each of the items, the user can update each items description and price, delete the item, or 'star' an item to save it as a favorite. The user can interact with the app using the nav bar to go to different pages of the app, either Home, About, or Create new posting, where they can create new items that are then saved to the home page's list of items. 
The user is able to login and logout with their initial username and password or create a new one. 

Lessons learned: A few valuable lessons that I learned in the process of making this app include: 

  -Authorization using session cookies & Password protection. This process was slow going at first, but with the resources and lessons available to me, I was able to implement this into the app
   find and practice this process in order to make it work! 

  -Deploying! This was my first project that I deployed so going through that process was very interesting, 
   and rewarding at the end! I plan on deploying a few more projects at least in order to get a better feel of the process.

Future Goals: Somethings that I plan on adding to this project include: 
  -ability to favorite an item and that item is added to a Favorites page
  -each item that is added to the list will show which user added it
  -each item will have a small image 
  -implement authentication where only certain users have access to more features of the app. 

Acknowledgments: craigslist! 
  Along with the obvious references to craigslist, I utilized the help of my instructor, my peers, lessons from my current module and previous ones, and online resources available to me.
